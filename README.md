## üîç Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline on AWS that allows users to ask questions based on content extracted from PDF documents. It uses:

- **Amazon Textract**: To extract structured text from PDF files.
- **Amazon Bedrock**: To generate responses using foundation models (Titan, Mistral, etc.).
- **Pinecone**: As a vector database for semantic search and retrieval.
- **Python CLI**: For a live terminal-based interface to query the bot.
